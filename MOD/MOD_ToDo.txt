MOD to to to have a working MK3 card :

Currently, the expansion ports available on the ‘Denise ITX’ PCBN are NOT wired for the IPL0, IPL1, and IPL2 signals.
Action Replay needs these signals to function.

Therefore, you must connect them to the port.

- IPL0 pin25 of CPU is already connected to PullUp with R35, you need to connect also to Pin 40 (see DeniseITX_PinOutPort.jpg and DeniseITX_IPLx.jpg).
- IPL1 pin24 of CPU is already connected to PullUp with R35, you need to connect also to Pin 42 (see DeniseITX_PinOutPort.jpg and DeniseITX_IPLx.jpg)
- IPL2 pin23 of CPU is already connected to PullUp with R35, you need to connect also to Pin 44 (see DeniseITX_PinOutPort.jpg and DeniseITX_IPLx.jpg)

That all :)
